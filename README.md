# Restored Claude Code Source


![Preview](preview.png)


  This repository is a restored Claude Code source tree reconstructed primarily from source maps and missing-module backfilling.

  It is not the original upstream repository state. Some files were unrecoverable from source maps and have been replaced with compatibility shims or degraded implementations so the
  project can install and run again.

  ## Current status

  - The source tree is restorable and runnable in a local development workflow.
  - `bun install` succeeds.
  - `bun run version` succeeds.
  - `bun run dev` starts the restored CLI entrypoint and remains running as an interactive process.
  - A number of modules still contain restoration-time fallbacks, so behavior may differ from the original Claude Code implementation.

  ## Why this exists

  Source maps do not contain a full original repository:

  - type-only files are often missing
  - build-time generated files may be absent
  - private package wrappers and native bindings may not be recoverable
  - dynamic imports and resource files are frequently incomplete

  This repository fills those gaps enough to produce a usable, runnable restored workspace.

  ## Run

  Requirements:

  - Bun 1.3.5 or newer
  - Node.js 24 or newer

  Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  bun install

  Run the restored CLI:

  bun run dev

  Print the restored version:

  bun run version
